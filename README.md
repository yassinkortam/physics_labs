# Physics Labs

This repository contains physics labs from my Physics 4C class at Evergreen Valley College. Programming was not required as part of these assignments, but I created python programs anyways to aid in analyzing data that was collected using a Vernier LabQuest 2. 

Each folder corresponds to its respective lab and contains a python program, lab data in a csv file, and a lab report pdf.
